# from a number or a string.

'Call me Ishmael.'
# Text Sequence Type â€” str
# Textual data in Python is handled with str objects, or strings

# Boolean Type - bool
# Booleans represent truth values. 
# The bool type has exactly two constant instances: 
# True and False.

# Numeric Type - int
# Return an integer object constructed from a number or a string
# or return 0 if no arguments are given.

# None is the sole instance of the NoneType type.
